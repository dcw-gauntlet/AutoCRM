# Aesthetics
Professional, clean, and modern.  Grids, cards, and tables.  Grids.

Using MaterialUI.  Use theme.ts for colors.

Drop shadows and borders can help with distinction between elements.

Use tab switchers when we need to put lots of information and interactions on page.

Regular tables keep things compact and organized.

# Sizing
Never scroll to the side.  Scroll vertically.

Size as a percent of parent if you aren't using a grid.
